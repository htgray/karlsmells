  <h1> a showering myth i found on a website </h1>
  <p> Myth #3. The longer, the better.It's OK to enjoy the luxury of a long shower once in a while, but it's not what's best for your skin (not to mention your utility bill). Like heat, long showers can drain your skin of the oils it produces, says Jailman. Same goes for baths, unfortunately: Better to keep them short and moderate temperature </p>
